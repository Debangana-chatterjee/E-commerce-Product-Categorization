# E-commerce-Product-Categorization

## Introduction
In the rapidly evolving world of eCommerce, accurate product categorization is crucial for ensuring seamless customer experiences, reducing search friction, and increasing product discoverability. However, the sheer volume of diverse products poses a significant challenge. Current classification systems struggle to handle ambiguities, unconventional naming conventions, and multi-language data. This project aims to address these challenges through creating innovative solutions that enhance product categorization efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. We have to develop a text classification model that categorizes products with maximum accuracy based on description of the product.

## EDA
- We inspected the dataset to understand data structure, columns, summary statistics, checked and handled missing values, 
  dropped duplicate values and redundant columns.
- Analyzed the distribution of product categories to identify imbalances.
- Used bar plots to visualize the count of products in each category.
- Encoded product category column and visualized prominently appearing words in product description column.
